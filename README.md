## React E-Commerce Web Application

This project is the **Front-end part of an E-Commerce cloth selling website** using ReactJS (React.js).

I have used styled-components and material-ui libraries to add component-level style to every part of the web application.

Basically, this front-end web application consists of six pages namely:

* Home
* Register
* Login
* Cart
* Product
* ProductList

Now let's dive into each page. Before getting into each page, let us first understand the components of every page.

There are several components on every page. Out of which the common ones are:

* Navbar
* Announcement
* Newsletter
* Slider
* Footer

and also there are several other components like Product, Products, Categories, CategoryItem.

Then getting into each page one by one:
